# Fav-Mates

## About the Project
#### Description:
Fav Mates is a user friendly platform that connects hungry users to local restaurants.

#### Developer Motivation:
To challenge ourselves to create a platform that many app/web users are familiar with and deepen our understanding of MVC fundamentals. 

#### User Story: 
As a User I want to be able to connect to and order from local restaurants by me. I would prefer to have many restaurants to choose from and be able to easily view some popular items and prices. When I checkout, I want to see the items in my order, the total price, and the estimated time for delivery.
